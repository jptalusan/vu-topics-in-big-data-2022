# Tensorflow/Keras
* This example is for timeseries forecasting which is what we often need machine learning for in the lab.
* Pytorch is another machine learning package that can be used but they perform similarly, one of the only reasons to switch aside from preference or code base is that some people prefer to make models using one or the other, so it is much better to familiarize yourself with both.
